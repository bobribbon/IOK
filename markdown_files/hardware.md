//TODO// information on how to assemble?

### Encasing

The entire project was encased in a 3d printed enclosure. This is a good idea to keep everything together, and was very necessary to maintain the sterile environment of the hospital, but is optional. We designed ours to function both as an enclosure, as well as a resonance box for the speakers. 

//TODO// Add 3D print files and show interior pictures


The entire box was mounted on a [mixer stand](https://www.bax-shop.be/nl/19-inch-racks/quiklok-ql-400-desktopstand?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIs6SFkMzG5QIViIxRCh3yJQK5EAQYGCABEgIFMPD_BwE), which was capable of tilting to adjust for the projector angle. => TODO: as we want to project on multiple locations I guess?
All cables needed for the entire setup would first enter the enclosure, as to have a central connection point. This was we could incorporate a central power switch to cut power of the entire system (project, computer, webcam etc).
