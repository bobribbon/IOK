# TeamScheire

## project topic

[Team Scheire](https://www.canvas.be/team-scheire) is a canvas production in which they present the maker movement.

The use-case chosen for the 2nd season of Team Scheire by imec is creating an aid for anaesthetize children. Very often they are terrified in the hospitals.

A solution has been created in the form of an immersive enviroment in which the kids themselves interact.
